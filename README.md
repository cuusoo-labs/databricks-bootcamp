# Content structure

There are 3 types of content in this repository:

- `evr` : contains activities where everyone will attempt together (instructor and students)
- `ins` : contains activities that only the instructor will attempt for demonstration purposes. Students are welcome to follow along.
- `stu` : contains activities that students will attempt. The solutions will be reviewed at the end of the exercise.

Within each activity folder, there will be sub-folders for:

- `unsolved`: contains the unsolved starter code. Students should refer to the Python comments for instructions for the activity.
- `solved` : contains the solved solutions. `stu` activities will not contain the solved solutions until the end of the day.
- `resources`: contains datasets used for the activity.
